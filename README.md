# Residual Distribution Hydrodynamics Solver for Galaxy Formation Simulations
## WORK IN PROGRESS
Residual distribution solver for 2D Euler equations:
- 1st order LDA 
- 1st and 2nd order N
- 1st and 2nd order B

Delaunay triangulation construction routines (seperate from main code for now) using
- CGAL (periodic if required)
- qhull
